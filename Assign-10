/*
The trim() method is a built-in JavaScript/TypeScript string method that removes leading and trailing whitespace characters from a string. Whitespace characters include spaces, tabs, newline characters, and other characters that are used to represent horizontal or vertical spacing.

Here's a brief explanation of how trim() works:

When you call trim() on a string, it scans the string from both ends (beginning and end) and removes any whitespace characters until the first non-whitespace character is encountered from both sides.

The resulting string is a new string without any leading or trailing whitespace, but the original string remains unchanged.

It is essential to note that trim() only removes whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the string, not within the string.
